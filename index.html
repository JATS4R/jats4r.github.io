        <p><strong>JATS for Reuse</strong> (<strong>JATS4R</strong>) was formed to provide guidelines and tools to standardise
        the use of the <a href="http://www.niso.org/home/">NISO</a>
        standard <a href="http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/tag-library/1.1d1/index.html">Journal and Archiving Tag Set</a>
        (JATS) for tagging XML in publishing workflows. Although JATS is the most recent version of the National Library of
        Medicine's tag set, many of these principles will also apply to previous versions that publishers may be using. Within
        JATS, there are three sub sets with varying degrees of prescriptiveness - from most to least prescriptive, the Journal
        Archiving and Interchange set, the Journal Publishing set and the Article Authoring set. The flexibility of the Journal
        Archiving and Interchange set was intended to accommodate the requirements of different journals, allowing them to pick
        and chose which elements and attributes to include. As a consequence, however, there has been considerable divergence
        between publishers in the tagging of the individual components of different articles, preventing easy data mining and
        impairing direct comparisons between articles in separate journals.</p>

        <p>The JATS4R group was set by open access publishers and interested parties as a response to users attempting to reuse
        content licensed under <a href "http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> but being unable to programmatically
        locate specific licensing information in published articles. We will define best practice tagging guidelines for
        specific areas of interest (e.g. licenses, author contributions and display elements such as figures or equations) and
        develop tools (e.g. schematrons) to help publishers easily identify whether their content is compliant with those best practices. By doing
        this, we hope to promote the easy machine readability of content, thereby making research literature more accessible
        for data miners and reducing the complexity of moving and exchanging content on a large scale. Although the initial
        problem was raised with regards to the open access literature, it has wider scope and we would welcome contributions
        and the adoption of our recommendations by all publishers and producers of XML based research publications.</p>

        <p>We have already begun to draft recommendations for tagging, and you can see more examples as they
        <a href="https://github.com/JATS4R/elements/wiki/Draft-recommendations">emerge</a>.</p>

        <section id="tag-recs">
          <h2>Tagging recommendations</h2>
          <p>Currently, we have established <em>draft</em> recommendations in two areas:
            <a href='https://github.com/JATS4R/elements/wiki/Permissions'>permissions and licenses</a>,
            and <a href='https://github.com/JATS4R/elements/wiki/Math'>math formulas</a>.</p>
          <p>As we finalize these recommendations, we will move them from the GitHub wiki into
            pages on this site.  The detailed workflow for approving recommendations is still
            being worked out.
