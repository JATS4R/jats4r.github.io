      <p>JATS4R aims to help standardisation of XML used in scientific publishing workflows. We
        take specific areas of interest (such as licenses, equations or author contributions) and
        <a href="https://github.com/JATS4R/elements/wiki/Workflow">work</a> to define best practice
        tagging guidelines, along with tools that can help publishers identify whether their content
        is compliant with those best practices.</p>

      <p>By doing this, we hope to make the research literature more accessible for data miners, and
        to lower costs when content needs to be exchanged or moved at scale, by bringing more
        consistency to the way the literature is tagged. You can see examples of best practice
        tagging as they <a

        <h2>Tagging recommendations</h2>

        <p>Some of the main features of the tool are:</p>

        <ul>

          <li>
            <h4>Navigability.</h4>
            <p>While regulations are traditionally represented as
            monolithic blocks of text, they contain a great deal of embedded structure.
            eRegulations teases out that structure and uses it to present the text in a clean,
            readable form.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4> Inline Interpretations.</h4>
            <p>Many regulation paragraphs have official
            interpretations that have traditionally been displayed at the end of the
            regulation, forcing readers to swap back and forth between the regulation
            content and interpretation at the end. eRegulations parses the
            interpretations for each paragraph, and displays them right under the
            paragraph/section being interpreted.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4>Definitions.</h4>
            <p>We highlight words that have been defined in the regulation,
            and the user can click on the word and see it's definition without
            scrolling to the part of the regulation that defines that word.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4>Internal citations.</h4>
            <p>The parser parses out
            all internal citations in the regulation, and we display
            them as clickable links allowing easy navigation within a regulation.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4>Search.</h4>
            <p>We provide the ability to search for phrases across various versions of
            a regulation. </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4>Alternate versions of the regulations.</h4>
            <p>Regulations are evolving documents and are often displayed as changes
            to the base text. We present whole versions of regulations for each set
            of changes (We combine Final Rules that have a common effective date
            into a version). </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Comparing versions.</h4>

            <p>
            We show the difference between whole versions of regulations in a
            "redline" or word-by-word comparison view. All changes are expressed as
            additions (shown in green) or deletions (struck-through, lighter gray).
            This view clearly shows how a regulation changes.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4>Retrieve by effective date.</h4>
            <p>A user can also enter in a date,
            and retrieve the version of the regulation effective at that point in time. </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4>Section-by-section analysis.</h4>
            <p>The notices that compose a
            version of the regulation contain relevant analyses of the altered sections.
            We automatically pull that information out and make it accessible while
            reading the regulation text.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4>Responsive Design.</h4> <p>The application design is
            responsive, adjusting to the device and screen size of the user.</p>
          </li>

        </ul>

      <section id="samples-articles">
  <h2>Sample articles</h2>

    <p>
      There are three parts to the eRegulations application: a parser that
      converts regulation text into data (<a
      href="https://github.com/cfpb/regulations-parser">regulations-parser</a>),
      an API that hosts this data (<a
      href="https://github.com/cfpb/regulations-core">regulations-core</a>), and
      a webapp which uses the data from the API to construct
      beautiful and usable regulations (<a
      href="https://github.com/cfpb/regulations-site">regulations-site</a>).
    </p>

    <p> One would typically run the parser against a regulation once (for each
    version) to populate the API with all the necessary data. regulations-site
    would then use regulations-core to as necessary to display regulations.  </p>
  </section> <!-- /#architecture-->


  <section id="technology">
    <h2>Technology</h2>

    <p>regulations-parser is written in Python.</p>

    <p>regulations-core is a Django and Haystack application.</p>

    <p>
    The regulations-site front-end is a Backbone.js application nested within AMD
    modules using Require.js. We also use a Grunt-based build system with Jasmine
    for unit testing. On the back-end regulations-site is a Django application.
